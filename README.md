## 🧠 What This Portfolio Shows

- How I **translate real problems into ML solutions**
- How I focus on **measurable outcomes**, not just model accuracy
- How I think as a **product-minded AI practitioner**

If you're building anything at the intersection of **AI, analytics, and product**, I’d love to connect.
